v1.0.0.5:
----------
1. Updated the labels to slightly match PassGen.
2. Added an option to include hyphens (-'s).
3. Increased the timer to 30s because I felt 10s was too short.
4. Added menu items (Exit, Website, etc.) and a pointless "About" form which just includes a copy of The Unlicense text.
5. You can now save your settings to the registry upon exit, these will be saved under: HKCU\Software\Github\Jigsy1\UUID2\
     The existence(?) of the registry entry will always be viewed as "Save Settings to Registry on Exit."
     This can be stopped either by unchecking this option in the menubar (which deletes the key), or simply by deleting the key from the registry itself.
6. Pressing F5 or the Generate button now resets the timer if it is enabled.

v1.0.0.4:
----------
1. App version now appears in the titlebar.
2. Added error checking to the copy button to prevent it from crashing if it fails to copy to clipboard.
3. You can now end the program by pressing Escape (Esc).
4. You can now generate a new "UUID2" by pressing F5 (Refresh).
5. Other minor changes. (Tidied up the code, uniform button width, wording changes, etc.)

v1.0.0.3:
----------
1. Increased randomness parameters.

v1.0.0.2:
----------
1. Like my password generator, added an option for "increased randomness." (Not set as default.)
2. Minor tidying up of the alignment and things of that nature.

v1.0.0.1:
----------
1. Rephrased settings. (Now using the correct term, {Braces}!)
2. Corrected the tab ordering.

v1.0.0:
----------
1. Initial release.
