# UUID2
I recently found out about UUIDs, but I decided to make my own variant which includes letters as well.

# Python3 version:

A simple GUI in Python 3✲ which generates an alpha numeric "UUID" and outputs it to the active terminal and copies it to the clipboard.

✲I don't know Python 3 (yet), this was just thrown together based on my limited knowledge and after reading some tutorials on how to use tkinter.

# Visual Basic 6 version:

Simple dialog which allows for a little more in terms of options such as using lowercase letters, braces, and automatic generation every 30s.
