# UUID2
I recently found out about UUIDs, but I decided to make my own variant which includes letters as well.

A simple GUI in Python 3✲ which generates an alpha numeric "UUID" and outputs it to the active terminal and copies it to the clipboard.

✲I don't know Python 3 (yet), this was just thrown together based on my limited knowledge and after reading some tutorials on how to use tkinter.
